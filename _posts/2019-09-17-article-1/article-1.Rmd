| Researchers                  | The microbiologist Jan CARETTE and his colleagues, of Stanford University                        |
| Published in?                | [*Nature Microbiology*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-019-0551-1) (16 september 2019)                                                       |
| General topic?               |  Common Cold could be vanquished by inactivating a particular protein                      |
| Procedure/what was examined? | Beforehand, inactivate single genes in different human cells, spanning the entire genome. Then, infect those cells with two severals enteroviruses. Next, look at which gene is missing in cells that survived. Finally, test it by inactivating this gene in cells and infect those cells with different enteroviruses and look if they survive  |
| Conclusions/discovery?       |  Enteroviruses need the protein SETD3 for their replication and cells that don't have the gene to code this protein are immune to those viruses      |
| Remaining questions?         | Will the drug that targets SETD3 be toxic for Human ? |
