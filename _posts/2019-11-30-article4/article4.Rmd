| General topic ?               | New images of the structure of the cytochrome b6f were taken |
| Procedure/what was examined ? | The procedure is cryo-EM. First, purify the complex from everyday spinach leaves. Place it in a solution and place the olution on a waffled carbon grid. Plunge it into liquid ethane cooled to –190 degrees Celsius. Finally, beam electrons on the sample and the three-dimensional image can be traced. |  
| Conclusions/discovery ?       | Pictures were taken of cytochrome b6f in differents states of the process, showing the shape changes. It clarifies the working of photosynthesis |
| Remaining questions ?         | How to use these researches in the future to improve the production of food and be sure there will be enough for the increasing population |
