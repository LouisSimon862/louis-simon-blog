| General topic ?               | A protein is responsible of the animals to feel the coming winter |
| Procedure/what was examined ? | Look a thousand genetic variations to find which gene is responsible of the perception of cold. Add different versions of this gene to worms (Caenorhabditis elegans) and mammalian cells that are cold-insensitive and look at their behavior. |  
| Conclusions/discovery ?       | GLR-3 protein is necessary to be sensitive to cold. The gene glr-3 makes the receptor for this protein and the worms that doesn't have it are cold-insensitive. |
| Remaining questions ?         | / |
