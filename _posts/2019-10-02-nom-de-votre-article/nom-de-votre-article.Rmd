| Researchers                  | The microbiologist Jan CARETTE and his colleagues, of Stanford University                        |
| Published in?                | *Nature Microbiology* (16 september 2019)                                                       |
| General topic?               |  Common Cold could be vanquished by inactivating a particular protein                      |
| Procedure/what was examined? | Beforehand, inactivate single genes in human cells. Then, infect those cells with two severals enteroviruses. Next, look at which genes are missing in cells that survived. Finally, test it |
| Conclusions/discovery?       |  Enteroviruses need the protein SETD3 for their replication and cells that don't have the gene to code this protein are immune to those viruses      |
| Remaining questions?         | Will the drug that targets SETD3 be toxic for Human ? |
