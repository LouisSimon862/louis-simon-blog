| General topic ?               | A key protein for the SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus to infect human cells |
| Procedure/what was examined ? | First, using the earlier published virus's genome, identify the specific genes that code for the protein and send it to a lab that create those genes. Then, inject the genes in mammalian cells that produce spike proteins. Finally, create the protein's 3D map, using the cryogenic electron microscopy method. |  
| Conclusions/discovery ?       | They visualised the 3D map of the virus's spike protein, and so all visualised the location of all the atoms. It will be useful to develop a vaccine. |
| Remaining questions ?         | Could just the protein itself be an efficient vaccine or not ? |
