| General topic?               |  Tardigrade have particular protein, Dsup, that protects it and make it nearly invulnerable |
| Procedure/what was examined? | (Untold in the article on Live Science, see the original publcation of the study on eLife) Treat the identified protein and then localise it with the "electrophoresis with mobility gel" methods |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | The protein Dsup binds to chromatin       |
| Remaining questions?         | / |
