| General topic ?               | How jasmonic acid acts to perceive troubles and counter it |
| Procedure/what was examined ? | First, plant *Arabidopsis thaliana* seeds (at the start keep it in the dark for three days to simulate the underground). After three days, expose it to jasmonic acid. Then, extrcat DNA and proteins from the plant cells and capture the exact genomic location of the regulators, using antibodies. identify genes that are important for the plant's response to jasmonic acid and for the intercellular communication with other plant hormonal ways, with using computational ways.|  
| Conclusions/discovery ?       | MYC2 and MYC3 are are very important genes because they code for transcription factor, they regulate the activity of a lot of other genes |
| Remaining questions ?         | It could be useful to select more resistant crops |
